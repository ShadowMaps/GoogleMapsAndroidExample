# GoogleMapsAndroidExample
An example application that submits directly to the API, and displays current location on a Google Map Fragment.

See ShadowMapsService.java for example of building and sending our JSON messages to the API.

See https://docs.shadowmaps.com for more API information.

To change from vehicular to pedestrian mode, press the button in the app, or to do so programatically see the code in GPSTestActivity.
